This repository offers a modular toolkit for engineers working with Ansys Electronics Desktop. It includes automation scripts, simulation templates, and integration utilities designed to accelerate workflows across IC design, PCB layout, thermal analysis, packaging, and circuit simulation.

## Tutorials
- Simulate and optimize antenna performance for wireless communication systems, such as designing a patch antenna for Wi-Fi or 5G applications.
- Design and simulate a microstrip antenna for a capstone project to study radiation patterns and impedance matching.
- Model and analyze the magnetic fields in a brushless DC motor to optimize torque and efficiency for electric vehicle applications.
- Extract parasitic parameters of a printed circuit board (PCB) to analyze signal integrity for high-speed electronics.
- Simulate parasitic effects in IC packages or connectors to optimize performance in power delivery systems.
- Simulate heat dissipation in a laptop or smartphone PCB to design efficient cooling solutions.
- Analyze heat sinks or fans in power electronics to prevent overheating in high-performance circuits.
- Model a battery management system for an electric vehicle to predict performance and optimize control strategies.
- Simulate sensor networks or smart devices to study system behavior under varying conditions.
